* To add a partonic process, copy and adapt the part between
* "BEGIN PARTONIC PROCESS" and "END PARTONIC PROCESS":
*
* PARTON1 and PARTON2 identify the incoming partons in
* lumi_hadron.F by their PDG code, where
* 0 = gluon
* 1 = down   3 = strange   5 = bottom
* 2 = up     4 = charm     6 = top


* NPID is the number of partonic processes.
