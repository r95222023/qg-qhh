* Possibly a colour factor, e.g.
* - an additional averaging factor if any of the incoming particles
*   carry colour (e.g. 1/8D0 for an incoming gluon),
* - the overall colour factor resulting from the external particles
*   if that cannot computed by FormCalc (e.g. if the model has no
*   colour indices, as SMew.mod).
* You MUST adapt partonic.h if not all subprocesses share this factor.
* deltaVariable in deltaSigma/deltaVariable is 10

* Whether to include soft-photon bremsstrahlung.
* ESOFTMAX is the maximum energy a soft photon may have and may be
* defined in terms of sqrtS, the CMS energy.

* Choose the appropriate luminosity for the collider:
* - lumi_parton.F for a "parton collider" (e.g. e+ e- -> X),
* - lumi_hadron.F for a hadron collider (e.g. p pbar -> X),
* - lumi_photon.F for a photon collider (gamma gamma -> X)

* For lumi_parton.F: whether to force the decaying particle to
* be on-shell, independent of the command-line choices for sqrtS;
* the value specifies the maximum value of |sqrtS - sum_masses_in|
